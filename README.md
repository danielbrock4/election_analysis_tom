## Challenge Overview

### Overview of Election Audit:

The Colorado Board of Election assigned Tom and me to work together. The Board has tasked us with completing an audit of a congressional precinct in Colorado.  The audit includes calculating the:
1) Total Number Votes
2) The Percentage and Number of Votes For Each:
  - Candidate
  - County
3) Largest Turnout Among All the Counties
4) The Winner of the Election

While the audit is generally done in excel, the Board wants us to use Python to automate this process and apply it to future elections and more significant elections. Excel is only limited to a million rows, so once the results are compiled into the CSV file, we wouldn't be able to do the audit on more significant elections like Senate races. Therefore, completing the audit in Python is the best method to conducting the audit.
