## Challenge Overview

### Overview of Election Audit:

I have been assigned to work with Tom at Colorado Board of Election. The Board has tasked up with completing an audit of a congressional precinct in Colorado.  We are tasked with calculating the:
1) Total Number Votes
2) The Percentage and Number of Votes For Each:
  - Candidate
  - County
3) Largest Turnout Amoung All the Counties
4) The Winnner of the Election

While this could be done in excel, the Board wants us to use Python, so we can automate this process and apply to future elections and larger elections. Excel only limited to a million rows, so once the results compiled into the csv file then we wouldn't be able to do the audit on larger elections like Senate races. This makes Python the best method to completing the audit.
